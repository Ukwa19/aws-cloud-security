# AWS Cloud Security Labs

This repository contains **hands-on labs and documentation** for a 30-day AWS Cloud Security challenge.  
Each day focuses on a specific security concept and demonstrates how to implement it safely and professionally in AWS.

The goal is to create **production-style security artifacts**, showing best practices in identity, networking, logging, encryption, threat detection, and governance.
